I've been thinking about taste lately. Not the kind that helps you pick a good restaurant, but the aesthetic sense that makes you stop scrolling when you see a particularly well-designed interface, or makes you bookmark an essay for its prose style rather than its conclusions.

There's something interesting happening when we say someone has "good taste." We're not just commenting on their ability to identify quality—we're acknowledging a kind of intellectual curiosity that manifests through aesthetic judgment.

## The curiosity signal

Good taste often correlates with curiosity about how things work. The person who notices that a website's typography feels just right is often the same person who will dig into the CSS to understand how the effect was achieved. The friend who always recommends books with unusual narrative structures is probably someone who thinks a lot about storytelling as a craft.

This makes taste a useful heuristic for identifying interesting people. Not because aesthetic preferences matter in themselves, but because the attention to craft and detail they represent usually indicates someone who thinks deeply about their interests.

## Taste as curation

In an age of infinite content, taste becomes a form of curation. The friend who sends you exactly the right article at the right time isn't just sharing information—they're applying a sophisticated filter that combines understanding of your interests, awareness of quality, and intuition about timing.

This curatorial sense develops through exposure and practice. You can't shortcut your way to good taste, but you can accelerate the process by paying attention to what draws your eye and asking why.

## The limits

Of course, taste can become a trap. When aesthetic judgment becomes too rigid, it stops serving curiosity and starts constraining it. The goal isn't to develop perfect taste, but to use aesthetic sensitivity as a tool for discovering what's worth your attention.

The best curators I know are the ones who occasionally surprise me—whose taste is refined enough that I trust their judgment, but flexible enough that they're still discovering new things.
